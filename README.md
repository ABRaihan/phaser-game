## Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `pnpm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development server by running `pnpm run dev`.

The local development server runs on `http://localhost:8080` by default. Please see the Vite documentation if you wish to change this, or add SSL support.

Once the server is running you can edit any of the files in the `src` folder. Vite will automatically recompile your code and then reload the browser.

## Template Project Structure

We have provided a default project structure to get you started. This is as follows:

- `index.html` - A basic HTML page to contain the game.
- `src` - Contains the React client source code.
- `src/main.tsx` - The main **React** entry point. This bootstraps the React application.
- `src/vite-env.d.ts` - Global TypeScript declarations, provide types information.
- `src/App.tsx` - The main React component.
- `src/game/PhaserGame.tsx` - The React component that initializes the Phaser Game and serve like a bridge between React and Phaser.
- `src/game` - Contains the game source code.
- `src/game/main.tsx` - The main **game** entry point. This contains the game configuration and start the game.
- `src/game/objects/` - The Phaser game all objects are in this folder.
- `src/game/scenes/` - The Phaser Scenes are in this folder.
- `public/style.css` - Some simple CSS rules to help with page layout.
